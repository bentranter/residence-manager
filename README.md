Getting this up and running
============================

Requirements: 
- Node.js 0.10.29 or newer
- A Mac or Linux machine (needs to be Unix)
- Meteor

To get Node.js:

http://www.nodejs.org

To get Meteor:

```bash
$ curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

Now, clone or download a .zip of this entire project.

Once this completes successfully, `cd` into the top of the cloned or unzipped directory (do something like this)

```bash
$ cd residence-manager
```

From here, its as simple as running:

```bash
$ meteor
```

This will download all packages required, and start your app on a local dev server. Go to `0.0.0.0:3000` in your browser to see the app running!
