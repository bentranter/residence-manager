Domain Analysis

Introduction

The project is to create a residence management system.  The residence management system is for the Lakehead University Thunder Bay Campus and is for three main residence types; residence halls, apartments and townhouses.  The project will include social support to residents.  Rooms in the residence hall will have double, basic single or single in size and each will come with a meal plan.  The rooms in the apartments and townhouses are only for upper year students.  A manager will have access to student’s accommodations, information on accommodations and be able to post notifications for residents.  A resident will access to housing information and apply for housing.  The resident can also use a commenting system as a way to report repairs, make notifications to others and to provide feedback to the manager.

Glossary

General knowledge about the domain

We looked at other reservation systems, like video rental, library and other reservation systems.  Our project would be similar to those systems in theory.  We would need a user that can reserve by asking a manager for permission first before a reservation can be made.  Since, our users will need to pay for their rooms, we will need accurate personal information from the user.  The project will also need adequate security for the payment process.

Customers and users

In this project, our users will be future students requiring housing, current students wanting continuing housing, and a manager to look after the students.  The manager will need to be trained in using the reservation system because of the complexity needed to be the manager.  The users will not need training to use the reservation system.

The environment

The reservation system will work on any computer or device connected to the internet.

Tasks and procedures currently performed

The procedures needed by a reservation system are a secure login system, an information system, a payment system, a way to register, a commenting system and a way to manage users.

Competing software

There are other reservation programs out there for housing.  Since this is only a smaller reservation system, a smaller reservation system can work for this type of reservation system.  Planyo and OnRes are two examples of reservation software that can easily configured to mimic the client needs.

Similarities across domains and organizations

In each reservation system, the user needs to reserve something.  Often a manager is needed to approve reservations.  Other reservation system do not require a manager for approval before a reservation is made.  Some reservation systems need a payment system, but other systems may not.


Requirements Gathering


Functionality

Our reservation system will need to be able to make a reservation for a room at the Lakehead University.  The system will allow the user to pay by keying in information.  The user will be created in a database.  The user will be able to leave comments on a comment system to make repair requests, to ask the manager a question or many other uses a comment system can have.  The manager will be able to manage the system of users.  The manager will be able to manage the comment system and will be able to notify using the comment system.  The system will be secure.

Observation

I talked to some of the students that live in the residence about the procedure required to get a room at Lakehead University.  They said it wasn’t easy to navigate and had a hard time with the current reservation system.  They described the process.  The process was complicated and not very clear on what to do next.  However, the system did work.  The system took the students information, made a reservation and allowed the manager to approve the reservation.  The system was not user friendly, but database friendly.  Our system will need to be more user friendly and database friendly.
